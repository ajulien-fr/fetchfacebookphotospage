FetchFacebookPhotosPage is a wppb plugin that fetch a photos from one album of one Facebook page.

I had to create this plugin for the WordPress of a French association.
I decided to make it public to help a programmer who would like to do the same thing ...

This code can be modified at your convenience ...

So, this plugin after it started fetch all photos from one album of one facebook page, create a post for each photos with its thumbnail.
The plugin have a daily event for the update.
